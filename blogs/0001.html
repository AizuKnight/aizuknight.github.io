            </header>
            <p>
                When I retreive local time with ESP32, I sometimes get false as return value. It means the year value in ESP32 is less than 2016.

                    <p>
                        I tried to print tm structure out. Then the problem was fixed. I don't know why.

                    Something seems to have to done to get local time properly.

                        I tried built-in sample clock program named SimpleClock. Then it worked. And then, I uploaded my program again and it worked. Fine. Good. Alright.
